The assignment is broken down into the below documents due to the excessive time in running the code so I run them separately for each question (bullet point).
Notebook 1 – Question 1 is on Decision Tree
Notebook 2 – Question 2  is on Random Forest and Rebuild of Random Forest with Top 10 Variables from Variable Importance Plot
Notebook 3 – Question 3 is on Decision Tree  with Top 10 from Variable Importance Plot.
